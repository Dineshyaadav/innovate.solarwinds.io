                    The 2017 Summit was held on December 14, 2017 in Brno, Czech Republic. Many joined us for an evening of talks from experts and fellow devs on topics within the <em>cloud native</em> ecosystem, ranging from containers to serverless. The talks were followed by a happy hour to network and have fun.
