                    Innovate is a one-day event and a great opportunity for you to
                    meet and learn from SolarWinds engineers and others in the monitoring
                    community.
                </p>

                    Spend the day hearing talks from experts and fellow devs on topics ranging 
                    from in-field issues to cutting-edge technology that you should 
                    be keeping an eye on. Finish the day off with a social happy hour, where 
                    you can network and just get to know your local monitoring community 
                    a little better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are passionate about monitoring solutions, and we're excited to 
                    pull together a group that shares that passion and is interested in 
                    keeping up with how the industry is growing and evolving.
