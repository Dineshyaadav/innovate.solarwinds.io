  topic: Analytics Driven Development
  speaker: Karlo Zatylny
  description: "Software is written with functionality and debugging in mind. 
  Most often, programmers use logging as the primary method for debugging their 
  application. Performance counters are another way to track application behavior 
  and performance but can also be used to track problems and identify when and where 
  to look in log files for issues. This talk will focus on the use of analytics in 
  every day programming and the power it unleashes in helping programmers optimize 
  their time in searching for resolutions."

  topic: "Go-based IoT with Gobot"
  speaker: Trevor Rosen
  description: "You probably know of the Go programming language from things like Docker and Kubernetes. 
  But did you know it’s also great for IoT development? 
  The Gobot framework (gobot.io) provides interfaces for dozens of platforms and protocols, 
  implementing both high-level abstractions and low-level drivers. In this lightning talk, 
  Gobot contributor Trevor Rosen will show you how easy it is to control electronics with this sophisticated 
  and highly portable language."
