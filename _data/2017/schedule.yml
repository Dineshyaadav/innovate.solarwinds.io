  topic: Writing Monitor-Friendly Software
  speaker: Karlo Zatylny
  description: "Software is written with functionality and debugging in mind. 
  Most often, programmers use logging as the primary method for debugging their 
  application. Performance counters are another way to track application behavior 
  and performance but can also be used to track problems and identify when and where 
  to look in log files for issues. This talk will focus on the use of analytics in 
  every day programming and the power it unleashes in helping programmers optimize 
  their time in searching for resolutions."
